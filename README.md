##This project involves automating the setup and backup of a MySQL database on an AWS EC2 instance running CentOS using Ansible. 
The process begins with setting up MySQL and creating a database and table. Next, the AWS CLI is installed and configured on the instance to enable interactions with AWS services, specifically S3. 
Ansible is then installed for automation purposes. An S3 bucket is created to store the database backups. 
Finally, an Ansible playbook is written and executed to automate the process of taking MySQL backups and uploading them to the S3 bucket, ensuring the backups are securely stored and easily retrievable.
